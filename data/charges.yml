  :name: Crown Imperial Firework
  :description: The Amarr calendar is replete with feast days and many provide an
    opportunity to let off fireworks and indulge in complicated pyrotechnic displays,
    often accompanied by massed religious choirs and the sweeping music of symphonies
    to the glory of Empire. The 'Crown Imperial' firework is a favorite with the crowds
    and is at its most spectacular when seen in space.
- :id: 44261
  :name: Angels Arisen Firework
  :description: The Angel Cartel is more than just a criminal gang, at least in its
    own eyes, and uses complex and mystical iconography at every level of its organization.
    The Angels are much given to celebrating their successes in fine style and the
    'Angels Arisen' pyrotechnic charge is used to signal their greatest triumphs.
- :id: 44262
  :name: Blood Dagger Firework
  :description: The Blood Raider Covenant likes to spread fear and intimidate its
    victims, and any that might think of standing up to them, with display and shock
    tactics wherever possible. The use of pyrotechnic displays to overawe the credulous
    is a stock tactic and the 'Blood Dagger' firework nicely serves that purpose.
- :id: 44263
  :name: Wheel of Prosperity Firework
  :description: The Caldari are well known for their festivals, a means by which they
    enliven and relieve lives marked by service to the 'Big 8' megas as they strive
    to climb the corporate ladder. The 'Wheel of Prosperity' firework is a great favorite
    with Caldari citizens of all ages, signifying as it does the opportunities that
    are available to all in the market-driven society of the Caldari State.
- :id: 44264
  :name: Pulsar Flare Firework
  :description: Space makes a spectacular backdrop for fireworks but the zero-gravity
    environment also allows pyrotechnics to take special advantage and achieve effects
    that are truly awe-inspiring. The 'Pulsar Flare' firework celebrates astronomical
    phenomena while putting on a great show for the audience.
- :id: 44265
  :name: Wings of Victory Firework
  :description: Celebrations of victory and notable triumphs are often accompanied
    by glorious displays of fireworks. The Wings of Victory pyrotechnic is one of
    the most striking and justly famed for its clever use of micro-rockets to achieve
    its memorable effect.
- :id: 44266
  :name: Spacetime Singularity Firework
  :description: A truly impressive pyrotechnic display, the 'Spacetime Singularity'
    firework is often used in multiples, launched in carefully co-ordinated spreads
    to create vast geometric displays. A solo burst from this firework is still an
    incredible sight as streams of light radiate in six directions across space.
- :id: 44267
  :name: Crimson Scythes Firework
  :description: Ominous signal of the Blood Raider Covenant's yearly Crimson Harvest
    cult festival, the 'Crimson Scythes' firework is considered to be in rather poor
    taste when used for casual purposes. This has certainly not stopped it being a
    favorite among fans of the 'Sani Sabik Pop' music scene.
- :id: 44268
  :name: Four Freedoms Firework
  :description: 'This very popular Gallente firework is intended to celebrate the
    ''Four Freedoms'' that are considered to be at the core of the Federation''s way
    of life: the Freedoms of Thought, Expression, Association and Movement. This pyrotechnic
    expression of the Four Freedoms flowing out from the Federal constitution across
    space is a regular sight on Gallente holidays.'

  :name: Naughty People Firework
  :description: The Guristas Pirates are very proud of their roots in elite fighter
    and frigate squadrons of the Caldari Navy, and their trademark 'Naughty People'
    firework celebrates that heritage with a symbolic dogfight rendered in spiraling
    pyrotechnics.
- :id: 44270
  :name: Flames of the Rebellion Firework
  :description: A stunning celebration of the Great Rebellion, the explosive 'Flames
    of Rebellion' firework symbolizes the great breakout of the rebellion followed
    by the joining in one circle of the tribes of Minmatar. This firework is extremely
    popular with Minmatar of all ages. The Amarr Empire forbids its subjects from
    even owning this pyrotechnic, let alone permitting them to set it off. Capsuleers
    are less daunted by such proscriptions and Minmatar pilots delight in displaying
    it in Amarr territory.
- :id: 44271
  :name: Nation Uplifts Firework
  :description: Sinister and foreboding for most, this pyrotechnic has been used to
    shock and awe planetary and colony populations ahead of Sansha's Nation raids
    for the purpose of 'uplifting' the inhabitants. The use of the 'Nation Uplifts'
    firework is considered tantamount to shouting 'Fire!' in a Holovid Theater but
    capsuleers have been known to weave it into their own displays.
- :id: 44272
  :name: Fangs of the Serpent Firework
  :description: The Serpentis Corporation likes to hold celebrations for staff, clients
    and potential patrons of its extensive pharmaceutical manufacturing and research
    activities and the 'Fangs of the Serpent' firework is a signature of such events.
    The CONCORD and core empire authorities consider such gatherings to be meetings
    of 'a drug cartel and its criminal allies' but many still participate in the famed
    gatherings sponsored by Salvador Sarpati.

  :name: Focused Warp Scrambling Script
  :description: "Originally used by the adolescent hacker group The 'Fendahlian Collective'
    to break past high tech security firmware, these script packs contain intricate
    code which modify the inherent behavior of certain modules by directly inserting
    commands into the firmware. The applications of such technology was not lost on
    the major players and the kids who invented it now head their own research divisions.\r\n\r\nThis
    script can be loaded into a warp disruption field generator to focus its effect
    upon a single ship much like a standard warp scrambler. This allows the module
    to scramble ships of any size, including ships normally immune to all forms of
    electronic warfare."
